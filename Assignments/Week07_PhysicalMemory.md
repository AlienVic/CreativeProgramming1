PHYSICAL MEMORY
====

### DUE: TUESDAY, MARCH 28

This week, we'll take a break from the computer and think about the materiality of computation. Arthur C. Clarke [famously said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws) that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistiguishable from magic." Today's computers and their components can often feel so non-physical and invisible, they start to resemble [black boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box) that they might as well be magic. But even the tiniest piece of the computer – a single bit of memory – [has physical weight](http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/31326/is-a-hard-drive-heavier-when-it-is-full). By contrast, older computational systems are fascinatingly physical. Punched paper cards and tubes of mercury are easy to see and hold, whereas ["the cloud"](http://noahveltman.com/internet-shape) is so ephemeral that it's easy to take for granted.

Your assignment this week is create a speculative design for a physically-based memory system, one that can store data encoded in objects. You'll come up with ideas and build a paper prototypes, then construct a final version (though of course it doesn't have to actually work). Format, materials, scale, etc are all up to you, though the result should be entirely physical and not involve a computer. You're welcome to go low-tech and use cardboard and stuff from the grocery store, or use the Fab Lab's laser-cutter or 3D printer to make a high-end prototype.

A few things to think about:  
* Consider the creative and aesthetic qualities of your memory storage as well as its functionality. What does it look like? What does it feel like?  
* What kinds of data should your storage format be able to handle?  
* What might it mean (artistically, philosophically, critically) to store certain things (or *not* store certain things) in your invented format?  
* Is your system a useful, real-world product or an artistic object?  

For next week, bring in your finished memory device – we'll have a critique and start learning Python. (Be sure it's installed! See the `Also For Next Week` section below.)

### STRETCH GOALS  
Try adding these elements to your sketch:

* Can you write a spec or standard for the data format your system uses? (For extra fun, make it look like a fake document from the IEEE.)  
* Can you make another device that can read your memory system?  
* Rather than just be static memory (written once and not re-writable), can you make your memory device active (able to be erased and re-written many times)?  

### ALSO FOR NEXT WEEK  
Next week, we'll start learning the language [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) to create a bot. To make sure you'll be able to follow along, please check to make sure that Python is installed on your computer. To test if it's installed, you need to open the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) and enter a command:

* Mac: go to `Applications > Utilities > Terminal`  
* Windows: go to `Start > Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt`  
* Linux: (if you're on Linux then you definitely know where the command line is!)  

Once you have the terminal open, type in `python` and hit return. You should get some info at the top and a prompt where you could enter code. Exit this by typing `exit()` and hitting return. If you get an error, email me and we'll talk about how to get Python installed.

### GRADING RUBRIC  
Your project will be graded with the following rubric:

**10%:** Project meets technical requirements (correct file format, naming convention, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows creativity, attention to visual quality (composition, color, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows clear use of technical material covered in class  
**30%:** Project shows investigation and exploration of assignment topic
